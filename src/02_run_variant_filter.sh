# Code for variant filtering steps.
# [Note, as written, all code should be run from the base directory, not within this directory.]

# First, grab the variant information table: 
Rscript 00_filter_variants.R

# Then get the xy chromosome stats and run LD filtering:
01_get_xy_chr_stats.sh ${CHR}
sbatch 02_submit_ld.sh ${CHR}

# After this, we put things together in a table:
Rscript 03_qc_filtering.R
# and then filter: 
Rscript 04_qc_filtering_part2.R
