# reformatting phenotype file for snpnet

To apply `snpnet` to fit PRS models, we prepared a phenotype file in a table format.

- [`snpnet_phe_file_prep_v1.ipynb`](snpnet_phe_file_prep_v1.ipynb): an initial run with a slightly different set of covariates.
- [`snpnet_phe_file_prep_v2.ipynb`](snpnet_phe_file_prep_v2.ipynb): the phenotype definition used in the final set of analysis.
- [`snpnet_phe_file_prep_v2.1-basic-covars.ipynb`](snpnet_phe_file_prep_v2.1-basic-covars.ipynb): an additional analyais with a minimum (basic) set of covariates.
